# Parallelizing-the-table-constraint-on-GPU
In this project, you will improve the state of the art in GPU-based constraint solving by
providing the first parallel solving algorithm for the table constraint [MVHD14, DHL+16]. For
starter, you can read the description of the table constraint on the following website: http:
//www.minicp.org/ (part 7). The algorithm presented is designed for sequential execution.
You will need to design an algorithm for GPUs.
At the beginning of this project, you will have a crash course on constraint solvers and the
basic techniques involved.
